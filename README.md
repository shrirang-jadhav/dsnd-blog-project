# DSND - Writing a blog-post Project

### Project Motivation:
This is part of portfolio projects for DSND.

We are using "Seattle Airbnb Open Data" available on Kaggle for this Analysis.
In this analysis, we focus on answering following questions :

1. What is the trend wrt Availability of listing on Airbnb in different Neighbourhoods of Seattle ?
2. What is the trend wrt listing-prices on Airbnb in different Neighbourhoods of Seattle ?
3. Do we see Seasonality as well as Day-of-week influencing Prices ?
4. Can we determine important factors which influence listing-price the most on Airbnb ?



### Important Files:
1. `data/listings.csv` : airbnb seattle listings details
2. `data/calendar.csv` : Date wise listing info wrt price, availability of airbnb seattle listings
3. `data/reviews.csv`  : listing-reviews details for airbnb seattle listings
3. `code/DSND-blog-project.ipynb` : python3 code to perform EDA as well as model building exercise to find answers to quesions listed above
